      <p>Download and run from our website as normal. Bitcoin XT uses the same data directories
      and configuration as Bitcoin Core, so if you were previously running that you won't need to download the block
      chain again. On first run you will need to reindex the blockchain by adding the <em>-reindex</em> switch.

      <p>Bitcoin XT is fully compatible with the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network.</p>
      <p>When running on the Bitcoin (BTC) network, segwit transactions cannot be fully validated.</p>

      <h2><a href="#why-did-the-xt-fork-happen" id="why-did-the-xt-fork-happen" title="Why did the Bitcoin XT fork happen?">#</a> <b>Why did the Bitcoin XT fork happen?</b></h2>
      <p>Bitcoin XT was created due to a series of fundamental disagreements between Bitcoin core developers. The
      disagreements revolve around questions like "Should the block chain grow to match user demand?", "What data
      should the Bitcoin protocol provide to clients?" and "How should technical decisions be made?".</p>

      <p>The biggest and most intractable disagreement is about the block size: the XT community believes the block size
      must grow in order to support Bitcoin's expanding user base. The Bitcoin Core project has made no move towards increasing the limit, in order to incentivise the creation and use of alternative, non-block chain based
      financial systems such as the so-called Lightning network. This is an irreconcilable difference of vision that has
      proven impossible to surmount.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the Bitcoin Core developers have made statements that imply they no longer care about unconfirmed
      transactions or lightweight peer to peer wallets, although both are relied upon by many users. Without the Bitcoin Cash fork
      these features would not have remained viable.</p>

      <p>The final area of disagreement is around how decisions are made. Bitcoin Core has no process for
      resolving disagreements amongst its developers or defining who those developers actually are.</p>

      <p>After a long series of attempts to find compromise in 2015, it became clear that there was no way to resolve these differences except via a fork.</p>

      <h2><a href="#hard-fork-alternatives" id="hard-fork-alternatives" title="Why can't alternative approaches to the hard fork be used?">#</a> <b>Why can't alternative approaches to the hard fork be used?</b></h2>

      <p>The max block size limit is a rule that every node checks. It was put in as a temporary measure by Satoshi
         and always intended to be removed, which implies a hard fork as older nodes will reject blocks created by newer
         nodes. The alternative most heavily promoted is the "Lightning network" by Blockstream, which is an entirely
         different system: it would require completely different wallets, a replacement for Bitcoin addresses/QR codes,
         new node software and so on. Lightning posits a set of relationships between quasi-institutional entities that
         settle up between each other on the block chain from time to time. It is unimplemented and many design elements
         are not yet defined.
      </p>

      <p>
         In short, the only alternative seriously proposed involves abandoning Bitcoin as we know it today and attempting to convince users to move to a largely undesigned and potentially worse alternative.

      <p>In the case of a block size change, no soft fork is possible because old nodes will realise they are not checking
      the same rules as soon as they see a block larger than what they are expecting. Any attempts to trick them into
      believing the 1mb rule is still being followed would require radical modifications to the protocol and major changes
      to all wallets, which is impractical. Additionally, as old nodes would have to upgrade anyway in order to preserve
      their security level, there is no benefit to doing a soft fork.</p>

      <p>Decisions are made by the current maintainer with input from the Bitcoin XT development team. When there is a disagreement the current maintainer will have the final say. If a patch seems in line with the principles of the project it will be considered for inclusion. If the developer is willing to assist with rebasing work, that also helps build the case for inclusion.</p>
